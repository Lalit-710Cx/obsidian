# Authentication
Master exploiting authentication mechanisms through real-world scenarios, covering enumeration and brute force, session management, OAuth, MFA/2FA and JWT vulnerabilities.

## Enumeration & Brute Force: 
supplied password doesn't satisfy the policy defined in the **pattern** variable
```php
<?php
$password = $_POST['pass']; // Example1
$pattern = '/^(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[\W_]).+$/';

if (preg_match($pattern, $password)) {
    echo "Password is valid.";
} else {
    echo "Password is invalid. It must contain at least one uppercase letter, one number, and one symbol.";
}
?>
```

### Common Places to Enumerate:
- [ ] **Registration Pages**
- [ ] **Password Reset Features**
- [ ] **Verbose Errors**
- [ ] **Data Breach Information**

### Verbose Error
- **Internal Paths**: Like a map leading to hidden treasure, these reveal the file paths and directory structures of the application server which might contain configuration files or secret keys that aren't visible to a normal user.
- **Database Details**: Offering a sneak peek into the database, these errors might spill secrets like table names and column details.
- **User Information**: Sometimes, these errors can even hint at usernames or other personal data, providing clues that are crucial for further investigation

### Inducing Verbose Errors
1. **Invalid Login Attempts**: Intentionally entering incorrect usernames or passwords, attackers can trigger error messages that help distinguish between valid and invalid usernames. For example, entering a username that doesn‚Äôt exist might trigger a different error message than entering one that does, revealing which usernames are active.
    
2. **SQL Injection**: This technique involves slipping malicious SQL commands into entry fields, hoping the system will stumble and reveal information about its database structure. For example, placing a single quote ( `'`) in a login field might cause the database to throw an error, inadvertently exposing details about its schema.
    
3. **File Inclusion/Path Traversal**: By manipulating file paths, attackers can attempt to access restricted files, coaxing the system into errors that reveal internal paths. For example, using directory traversal sequences like `../../` could lead to errors that disclose restricted file paths.
    
4. **Form Manipulation**: Tweaking form fields or parameters can trick the application into displaying errors that disclose backend logic or sensitive user information. For example, altering hidden form fields to trigger validation errors might reveal insights into the expected data format or structure.
    
5. **Application Fuzzing**: Sending unexpected inputs to various parts of the application to see how it reacts can help identify weak points. For example, tools like Burp Suite Intruder are used to automate the process, bombarding the application with varied payloads to see which ones provoke informative errors.

            else:

### Password Reset Flow Vulnerabilities
- [ ] **Email-Based Reset**
- [ ] **Security Question-Based Reset**
- [ ] **SMS-Based Reset**

## Session Management
session management is the process of taking down the method of all cultural which can lead to be a part of sql injection for all kind of data structure
